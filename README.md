# GL prototype
A next iteration of an OpenGL engine prototype.
[First one](https://github.com/dvoraka/pygl-test) was simple fixed pipeline OpenGL test in Python.
[Second one](https://github.com/dvoraka/pygl-prototype) was programmable pipepline OpenGL test in Python.
Now it is time to use Java and create something much bigger than before.

### Components
 * **JOGL**

### Plan

#### 1. stage
Preparation of data structures.

#### 2. stage
Performance testing and improving data structures.

#### 3. stage
Preparation of separate rendering engine.

#### 4. stage
Merging some data structures with rendering engine.

#### 5. stage
Improving rendering engine according to data usage.

#### 6. stage
Data structures optimization.

#### 7. stage
Rendering almost every visible data structure.

#### next
* Add collisions
* Moving objects
* Add new effects to rendering
* ...
